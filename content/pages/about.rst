First and foremost, **welcome to my humble blog**. I hope you have found/are
going to find something helpful or interesting here. And thank you for giving
me a chance to introduce myself.

Who am I?
---------

My name is JarosÅ‚aw Wierzbicki and I'm the person in the photo.

The photo was taken on the Elephant Mountain in Taipei City where I currently
live... not on the mountain but in the city. ðŸ˜‰

I am and have been a software engineer professionally for a little more
than 10 years now. My language of choice is C, but I've also worked or am still
working with C++, Java, Groovy, Python and JavaScript.

My professional career so far has mostly been with embedded systems
oscillating somewhere between user space and kernel programming. In my less
professional environment, I enjoy involving myself with web design and totally
outside of work, I go to the gym to keep myself fit, I'm trying to learn Chinese
(with arguable effect) and I do enjoy a good book and film.

Why did I create this blog?
---------------------------

Maybe it's going to sound tacky, but to give back to the community. For all
of those years I've been building my knowledge (well I very much still am) with
help from so many great people and sources and I have decided that it's time to
start sharing too. So this is my attempt to do so.

Should you wish to contact meâ€¦

While you are visiting please use one of the social media links in the footer
of this page and say hi. While it looks like I'm not very proactive in that area
I will for sure reply and I will do so with great pleasure.
